# @dxv/cli

A simple wrapper around [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [dprint](https://dprint.dev/).

Please consider sponsoring those projects:

- [eslint](https://github.com/sponsors/eslint)
- [dprint](https://github.com/sponsors/dprint)

## ðŸš§ Work in progress
There may still be inconsistencies between eslint and dprint rules that will be sorted out with time.

In addition, this cli tool does not yet recognize project-specific eslint and dprint config files, though that will be added eventually.

## Install

```shell
npm i -D @dxv/cli
```

## Usage

```shell
dxv lint
dxv format
dxv help
```
